		All exposed cards in the pyramid are available for play.  Kings can be
		removed singly.  All other cards can be removed in pairs that add up to
		treize with Aces equal to 1, Jacks equal to 11, and Queens equal to 12.

		Cards can be flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste.  Top and bottom
		cards are available for play either by themselves or with the available
		cards in the pyramid.  The top card of the Waste can also be played with
		the second card on the Waste.  There is no redeal.

	<para>
		Removing the bottom of the inverted pyramid is the hard part.  Once that
		is achieved, it is sometimes better to remove cards from the Waste than
		the inverted pyramid, as there are more cards in play there.
