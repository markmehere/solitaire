    Build on to Foundations in sequence from Ace to King regardless of
    suit.  Cards in Foundations are no longer in play.  Cards are dealt
    singly in to the Waste from the Stock.  However, as the Waste pile
    can only hold one card, this card must immediately be played on to a
    Foundation pile or on to any of the four Reserve piles.  Cards in
    the Reserve piles cannot be rearranged.
