			Ten piles across the bottom.  To deal place 10 cards across going from
			left to right with the first and last cards face up.  Continuing you
			place ten cards across the piles from right to left (reversed) with
			the first two and last two cards placed face up.  Continue this
			pattern (reversed and one more card each pass) until 50 cards have
			been placed.  Place the last two cards in the temporary spots at the top.

		Form four piles in the tableau all of the same suit running from King
		to Ace.

	<para>
		Only a King may be moved to a blank tableau spot.
	</para>
	<para>
		Cards may be moved only onto other cards if the suit matches and the
		moved card is one less than the moved to. This includes moving a pile
		of cards of different suits as long as the top card of the moved pile
		matches the bottom card of the location moved	to.

        <sect2><title>Estratexia</title>

	<para>
		This game is hard to win (being very influenced by how the cards are
		placed to begin with). Don't forget you have the temporary spots.  Try
		to clear them quickly because they are very useful when you get stuck.
