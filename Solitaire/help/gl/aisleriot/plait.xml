		All eight Foundations have to be started with the same card value.
		At the beginning you can choose whether to build up or down.
		You can take cards from the plait in the middle of
		the tableau, from the eight free fields left and right of the plait,
		from the four edges around the plait, and from the waste.
	</para>
	<para>
		The game is lost if no available cards can be moved on to the
		Foundation piles and the Stock is empty.

        <sect2><title>Estratexia</title>

	<para>
		Pick the cards from the plait as soon as possible as they are hard to free.
		Then pick the cards from the tableau as it will give you empty slots
		to temporarily store some cards.
