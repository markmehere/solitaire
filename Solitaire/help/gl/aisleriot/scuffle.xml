    Play begins by dealing four cards face up on to the Reserve.  If
    possible, play cards on to the Foundation from the Reserve.  Continue
    this process until no cards are left in stock and no more moves on
    to the Foundation can be made.
  </para>
  <para>
    Take all cards left over on the Reserve and reshuffle.  Place these
