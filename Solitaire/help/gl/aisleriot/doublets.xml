	    Seven piles, forming an arch shape (upside down U) to the
	    right.  Deal one card face up on each pile.  During this
	    deal, if a King is dealt, remove the King and place it on
	    the bottom of the deck.  Deal another card into this pile.
	    Each Reserve pile can only hold one card.  When a Reserve
	    pile is empty, it is automatically filled by the Waste, or,
	    if the Waste is empty, from the Stock.  Once original deal
	    is over, when a King is placed in a pile of the Reserve,
	    this pile is frozen as Kings cannot be moved.

    goes:
