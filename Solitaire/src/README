How to compile AisleRiot on different platforms
===============================================

The AilseRiot code supports different platforms: GNOME (using GConf), and
GTK only.

To compile it for some platform, configure with

    ./configure --with-platform=gnome
  or
    ./configure --with-platform=gtk-only

Environment variables
=====================

You can set the following environment variables to influence the
behaviour of AisleRiot:

AR_DEBUG:
  Values: all | help | ...

  Use AR_DEBUG=help to get a list of supported debuggin options.

AR_CARD_THEME_PATH_{SVG,KDE,SLICED,FIXED,PYSOL}:
  Values: a colon-separated list of paths
  Default: empty

    Set these variables to add extra paths to check for card themes.

Debugging & Valgrinding AisleRiot
=================================

If you configure with --enable-debug, there is extra debugging
output available by setting the GAMES_DEBUG env variable. Use
GAMES_DEBUG=help to see the list of available debug flags.

When using valgrind, use the included ../data/aisleriot.supp suppressions file to
suppress common valgrind errors relating to guile's garbage collection.

There are also some debugging options available in the UI if you
configure with --enable-debug-ui .
