      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. All remaining cards are placed here after dealing.</td></tr><tr><td>Waste</td><td>Top right pile. Can only hold one card.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Four piles. One card is dealt in each slot at the beginning of the game. Redealing from the stock moves all cards currently in the Tableau to the bottom of the Stock slot.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Have all the cards in the Tableau, each slot containing Ace to King
        of one suit. Avoid going crazy achieving this.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        If any two cards dealt on to the Tableau are the same suit and in
        sequence, place the lower card on to the higher. Aces are low,
        Kings are high and sequence does not wrap. Click on the Stock
        to fill in the empty slots that are made.
      </p>
      <p>
        When no plays can be made in the Tableau, click on the Stock to
        deal a card on to the Waste. If this card can be played on to any
        of the Tableau piles, do so. Repeat this process until there are no
        more moves in the Tableau or from the Waste.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, clicking on the Stock again moves all the cards
        in the Tableau back to the bottom of the Stock. The card in the
        Waste is put in the first Tableau pile and the rest of the Tableau
        is filled with one card to each pile from the Stock.

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        A great game for killing time, Valentine really has no strategy,
        unless the strategy is to play it instead of doing other, more
        important things, like going to bed.
