      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left slot. Since all remaining cards are always dealt to the tableau, it will always be empty. Redeals are unlimited.</td></tr><tr><td>Foundations</td><td>Rightmost piles in the top row; the aces are placed here upon the start of the game. Build up in suit from ace to king.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Up to thirteen piles, dealt four cards at a time until the stock is exhausted. Tableau piles can be built down in suit.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the foundation piles.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Build foundations up in suit and tableau piles down in suit. If no
        moves are available (or you just feel like it), click on the empty top
        left slot for a redeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Redeals are accomplished by placing the tableau piles on top of each
        other in order, starting from the last pile. Then the deck is simply
        turned over and redealt, four cards at a time, back to the tableau. If no
        moves are made, redealing will not alter the arrangement of the
        cards. Therefore, the game is lost if no move is possible immediately
        after a redeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: a degenerate case occurs whenever, after a redeal, the last
        tableau pile contains only one card and the only move possible is from
        the final tableau pile one before it. Making this move and redealing only
        results in the original card arrangement. AisleRiot will end the game if
        this situation is detected.

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card placed in the foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        If more than one pile on the tableau can be built upon, choose to build
        upon the one with the highest rank first.
