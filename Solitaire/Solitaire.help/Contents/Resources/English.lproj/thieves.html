      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Joker Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Seven piles of five cards each, face up.</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Place all remaining cards here. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. No redeals.</td></tr><tr><td>Waste</td><td>To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.</td></tr></tbody></table>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to Waste.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        The Waste can be built up or down from the available cards on the
        Tableau. Jokers are wild and can be played on any rank as well as
        be played upon by a card of any rank.
      </p>
      <p>At any point, a card can be dealt from the Stock to the Waste.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        The following table shows the points you receive for each type of card.
        No points are scored for jokers.
      </p>
      <table><thead><tr><td>Card</td><td>Points</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ace</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>2, 3</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>4, 5</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>6, 7, 8</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>9, 10</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Jack, Queen</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>King</td><td>8</td></tr></tbody></table>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Since you can see all the cards on the Tableau, try to engineer
        `runs', to try and get rid of as many cards up there as possible, as
        you only have a finite supply of cards in Stock.
