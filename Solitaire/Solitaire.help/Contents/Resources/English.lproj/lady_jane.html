      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing. Cards are turned on to the Reserve one on each pile per deal. When there are only two cards left in Stock, they are dealt such that both cards are available for play.</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation</td><td>Four piles on top right. Deal one card on to first Foundation pile after dealing on to Tableau and Reserve. This card is now the base card. Built up by suit.</td></tr><tr><td>Reserve</td><td>Seven piles on the right. Top card of each pile is available for play on to either the Tableau or the Foundation. Empty spaces are not filled except by a deal from Stock.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Seven piles below Stock and Foundation. Deal card face up in first pile. Place one card face down on all other piles. Place one card face up on next pile followed by one card face down on all covered piles. Repeat until there are seven cards in last pile. Tableau can be built down in alternating colors. Groups of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by the card whose rank is one lower than the base card or group of cards starting with a card of this rank.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards on to Foundation piles.</p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Groups of
		cards can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a
		card whose rank is one lower than the base card or with a group of cards
		starting with a card with this rank.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards are dealt from the Stock to the Reserve. Each deal places one
		card on each pile of the Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The top card of each Reserve pile is always available for play on to
		either the Tableau or the Foundation. There is no building on the
		Reserve piles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from the base card. New Foundations
		are started when a card of the same rank as the base card is placed on
		empty Foundation piles. Aces are
		placed on Kings, and twos on Aces. Cards in Foundations are still in
		play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate
		Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The deeper something is, the harder it is to get to. Try and move cards
		out of the Reserve whenever possible.
