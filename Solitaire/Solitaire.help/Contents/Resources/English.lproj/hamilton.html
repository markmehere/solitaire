      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. The first three cards may be turned over one at a time to Chooser. After choosing a Start card, clicking on Stock deals one card face up to each pile in the Tableau.</td></tr><tr><td>Chooser</td><td>Top left, next to Stock. While the Start card is being chosen, clicking Stock deals the top card face up to Chooser. The card in Chooser can be moved to a Foundation. Or if Stock is clicked again, it is returned face down to the bottom of Stock, and the next card moved to Chooser.</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation</td><td>Four piles top right. To be built up in suit from the chosen Start card to King, then Ace to the card with value one less than the Start Card.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Seven piles. Deal one card face up to each pile. Start the second row on the second pile in the Tableau, and deal one card face up to each pile except the first. Repeat, till there are seven cards in the last pile. The Tableau can be built down by matching color. Groups of cards in order and in suit can be moved. Empty piles can be filled by any card or group of cards in order and in suit.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        To start the game, one card is flipped over from the Stock to the
        Chooser. This card can be moved to a Foundation, in which case it
        is the Start card for this game. Otherwise, the card in the Chooser
        is returned face down to the bottom of the stock, and the next card
        flipped over from Stock to Chooser. If none of the first three
        cards is chosen, the game is over. Double clicking on the Chooser
        will move the card there to a Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by color. A King may be placed
        on an Ace (unless the Start card is Ace). Groups of cards that are
        in suit can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled
        with any card, or with a group of cards that are in order and all
        the same suit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from the Start card to King, then
        Ace, Two, and so on to one less than the Start card. For example,
        if the Start card is Seven, the Foundations are built up from Seven
        to King, Ace to Six. Cards in Foundations are still in play.
      </p>
      <p>
        A group of cards that are in order and all the same suit can be
        moved to a Foundation in a single move. Double clicking on a pile
        in the Tableau will move all possible cards from that pile to the
        Foundation.

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card removed scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Choose wisely. If you cannot move to the Foundation all visible
        cards of the Start value, you are unlikely to win. An empty slot in
        the Tableau is invaluable.

      <h2>Dedication</h2>
      <p>
        This game is dedicated to, and named for, my father: Geoffrey
        Hamilton Goodwin (b. 1937). He taught me many patience (or
        solitaire) games; we both consider Hamilton the most interesting
        single-pack game.
