      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Create four piles of thirteen cards each built down in suit and sequence.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Tableau piles can be built down regardless of suit. Builds of
        cards in sequence and in the same suit can by moved as a unit.
        Empty Tableau piles can be filled with any card or build of cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Tableau pile must be filled before any deal. Clicking on the
        Stock will deal a card on to every Tableau pile except for the last
        deal which places one card on each of the first three piles.
      </p>
      <p>
        A build of all thirteen cards in a suit may be moved on to a
        Foundation pile. Cards in the Foundation are no longer in play.
      </p>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Every pair of cards in suit and sequence scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Try to keep a Tableau pile empty whenever possible to create a swap
        space for moving around cards.
