      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in Tableau are built down in opposite color. Groups of cards
		can be moved regardless of sequence. A faced-down card is flipped
		when it is unburied. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with
		a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in
		Foundations are no longer in play.
      </p>

      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Try and uncover as many cards as early on as possible. Doing so will
		greatly aid your quest to conquer yukon.
