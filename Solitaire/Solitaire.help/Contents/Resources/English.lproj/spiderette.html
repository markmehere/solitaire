      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. Deals a card to each Tableau pile when clicked.</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation</td><td>Four piles top right.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Seven piles on the bottom. Deal one card face down on all seven piles, then one on the last six piles, followed by one on the last five piles. Continue in this manner until you have seven cards in the last pile. Flip up the top card on every pile.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Create four piles of thirteen cards each built down in suit and sequence.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in Tableau can be built down regardless of suit. Builds of
        cards in sequence and in the same suit can by moved as a unit.
        Empty Tableau piles can be filled with any card or build of cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Tableau pile must be filled before any deal. Clicking on the
        Stock will deal a card on to every Tableau pile except for the last
        deal which places one card on each of the first three piles.
      </p>
      <p>
        A build of all thirteen cards in a suit may be moved on to a
        Foundation pile. Cards in the Foundation are no longer in play.
      </p>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Every pair of cards in suit and sequence scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Try to keep a Tableau pile empty whenever possible to create a swap
        space for moving around cards.
