      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Place all remaining cards here. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste.

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to Waste.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        The Waste can be built up or down from the available cards on the
        Tableau. Only Deuces can be placed on Aces and nothing can be
        played on to a King.
      </p>
      <p>Cards are dealt singly from Stock to Waste. There are no redeals.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Every card moved from Tableau to Waste scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 35</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Remember that nothing can be played on to a King. Try to generate
        sequences where many cards can be removed without a new card from
        Stock.
