      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. Two redeals.</td></tr><tr><td>Waste</td><td>Directly to the right of Stock. To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.</td></tr><tr><td>Reserve</td><td>Seven piles, forming an arch shape (upside down U) to the right. Deal one card face up on each pile. During this deal, if a King is dealt, remove the King and place it on the bottom of the deck. Deal another card into this pile. Each Reserve pile can only hold one card. When a Reserve pile is empty, it is automatically filled by the Waste, or, if the Waste is empty, from the Stock. Once original deal is over, when a King is placed in a pile of the Reserve, this pile is frozen as Kings cannot be moved.</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation</td><td>One pile, the center pile on the bottom row of the Reserve slots. To be built on from original card by doubling, regardless of suit or color.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation pile.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards can be put in the Foundation pile if they are twice the value
        of the card currently on top of the Foundation. Jacks and Queens
        are eleven and twelve, respectively. If the doubled number exceeds
        thirteen, subtract thirteen to find next needed card. The series
        goes:
      </p>
      <p>A, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, Q, J, 9, 5, 10, 7, repeat...</p>
      <p>
        Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste by one. When the
        Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock,
        maintaining order. You can go through the deck three times.
      </p>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation pile scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>Without a King, you can't have regicide. Avoid them.</p>
