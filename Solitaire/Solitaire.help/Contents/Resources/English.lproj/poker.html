      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Score as many points as possible using poker hands. There are
        twelve hands in the board -- 5 rows, 5 columns, and 2 diagonals.
        Scoring 75 points or higher is considered a win.

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Click on the Stock to flip over cards one at a time. The card must
        be placed somewhere on to the Tableau before the next card can be
        flipped. Once placed, a card cannot be moved.

        Shuffle mode: If selected, you can move the cards after they have

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Remember you are going to see almost half the deck and plan
        accordingly. Trying to bluff the computer is not recommended.
