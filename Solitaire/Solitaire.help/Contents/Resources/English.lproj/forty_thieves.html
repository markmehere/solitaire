      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in Tableau are built down in the same suit. Cards can only
        be moved singly. An empty pile in the Tableau can
        be filled with any card. As a short cut you can move more than one if
        there are enough empty spaces. Cards can also be moved in groups to the
        Foundation piles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards are played singly from the Stock to the waste pile, whose
        top card is available for play. There are no redeals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Double clicking
        on a foundation will autoplay cards. Double clicking on a card in
        the Tableau or waste will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile
        if such a move is possible, or to the tableau if possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        Each card in the Foundation scores 5 points. When a Foundation pile
        is complete (from Ace to King), 60 more points are scored.
      </p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 1000</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Refrain from bringing cards to the tableau in order to obtain an empty
        space as soon as possible. Then balance the requirements to maintain
        empty spaces against the need to save low cards from being buried in
        the waste.
