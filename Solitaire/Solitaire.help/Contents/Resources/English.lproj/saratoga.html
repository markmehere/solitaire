      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. Two redeals.</td></tr><tr><td>Waste</td><td>To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.</td></tr><tr><td>Foundations</td><td>Four piles top right. To be built up in suit from Ace to King. Topmost card in each Foundation can be played back on to the Tableau.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Seven piles. Place one card face up on all piles. Next row skip the first pile and place cards on all the other piles. Continue this process skipping one place to the right each row until there are seven rows with seven cards in the last pile. Essentially Saratoga is the same as Klondike only the all cards are face up to begin with. Being able to see all cards reduces the element of risk and makes Saratoga slightly easier than Klondike.<!--TODO FIXME link to Klondike Help page--></td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Builds of
        cards can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with
        a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top
        card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in
        Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the
        deck three times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in
        Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move
        it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.

        <para>
        Three card deals: If checked, the Stock will deal three each time.
        Otherwise, the Stock will deal singly into the Waste.
        </para>
        <para>
        King Only: If checked empty space may be filled with Kings or
        groups of cards starting with a King only.

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Don't give up the ship!
        Try brute force methods when the game seems
        over. Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the
        Foundation and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards.
