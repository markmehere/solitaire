      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Build on to Foundations by ones, twos, threes, and fours for piles
		one, two, three, and four respectively. Cards are dealt singly in to
		the Waste from the Stock. However, as the Waste pile can only hold
		one card, this card must immediately be played on to a Foundation pile
		or on to any of the four Reserve piles. Cards in the Reserve piles
		cannot be rearranged.

      <p>Each card moved to Foundations scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Hone your skills for this game. Luck will not get you very far here.
		Try not to cover cards you might need sooner. Consider saving a
		column just for kings (as they are the last card to be played on each
		Foundation).
