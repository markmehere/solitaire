        Cards in the Tableau are built down in suit. Groups of cards
		can be moved. An empty slot in the Tableau is filled automatically from
		the Reserve. If the Reserve is empty, an empty slot can be filled by the
		top card of the Waste at your leisure.
      </p>

        Cards can be flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste. Top

        Foundations are built up in suit from twos to aces. Cards in
