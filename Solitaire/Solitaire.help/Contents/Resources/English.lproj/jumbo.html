      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Groups of
        cards can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with
        a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top
        card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in
        Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. There is one redeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up from suit from Ace to King. Cards in
        Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move
        it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
      </p>
