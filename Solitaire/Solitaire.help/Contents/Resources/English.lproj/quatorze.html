      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. Empty spaces in the Tableau are immediately filled in with cards from the Stock.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Five-by-five grid, each capable of holding one card. One card dealt to each space at the beginning of the game. Empty spaces are filled in from the Stock. Once Stock is exhausted, spaces are filled by moving cards from the right to the left, from the leftmost card of the row below to the the rightmost space, leaving all empty spaces at the end.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards can be removed in pairs if they add up to fourteen (with Jacks
        being 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13) and are in the same row or column.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empty slots are automatically filled from the Stock. Once the Stock
        is exhausted, cards to the right of empty piles are automatically
        moved over to fill the space, with empty piles in the right column
        filled in by the cards of the leftmost column in the row below.
      </p>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each pair of cards removed scores two points.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Oftentimes in the middle of this game, there is only one move. Make
        it. Once the Stock is exhausted, there is much more movement in the
        Tableau.
