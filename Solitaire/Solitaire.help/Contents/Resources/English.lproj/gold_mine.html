      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Groups of
        cards can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with
        any card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste three at a time. Top
        card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, game over.
        Only one chance to get it right and establish your gold mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in
        Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move
        it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Be careful how you fill the empty foundation piles.
        With skill it is possible to win Gold Mine most of the time.
        If at first you do not succeed restart and try again.
