      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Build on to Foundations in sequence from Ace to King regardless of
        suit. Cards in Foundations are no longer in play. Cards are dealt
        singly in to the Waste from the Stock. However, as the Waste pile
        can only hold one card, this card must immediately be played on to a
        Foundation pile or on to any of the four Reserve piles. Cards in
        the Reserve piles cannot be rearranged.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card moved to Foundations scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>Try not to place cards of higher rank on to cards of lower rank in the Reserve.</p>
