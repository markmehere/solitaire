      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Remove cards in pairs of equal rank. Every time a card is removed,
        the card underneath is flipped face up and becomes playable. Empty
        slots are not filled.

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Each pile starts with four cards. The trick is to remember how many
        cards each slot has left at any given time so that you can try to
        remove cards evenly.
