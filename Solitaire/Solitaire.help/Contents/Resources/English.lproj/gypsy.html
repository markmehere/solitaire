      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in Tableau are built down by alternating color. Builds of
        cards can be
        moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled
        with any card or build of cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each deal flips one card from the Stock to each pile of the
        Tableau. There are no redeals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in
        Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card in the
        Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a
        move is possible.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        Each card in the Foundation scores 5 points. When a Foundation pile
        is complete (from Ace to King), 60 more points are scored. Each
        card pair on the Tableau in alternating order scores 2 points.
      </p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 1000</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Try and expose new cards in the Tableau whenever possible. Remember
        you can always bring cards from the Foundation back into play.
