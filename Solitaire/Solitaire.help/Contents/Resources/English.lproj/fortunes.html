      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Aces are high cards. When two cards of the same suit are available,
        the one with the lower rank can be removed. When an empty slot
        appears, it can be filled with an group of cards.

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        There is no reason to have an empty slot when dealing another batch
        of cards. However, when you have an empty slot, try to keep it
        empty as long as possible, as this is a great way to get rid of
        buried cards.
