      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards on to Foundation piles.</p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down regardless of suit. Groups of cards
		can be moved. An empty slot in the Tableau is filled automatically from
		the Reserve. If the Reserve is empty, an empty slot can be filled by the
		top card of the Waste at your leisure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards can be flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste. Top
		card is available for play. There is no redeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from the base card (first card dealt to
		first Foundation). New Foundations are started when a card of the same
		rank as this base card is placed on an empty Foundation pile. Aces are
		built on Kings, and twos on Aces. Cards in Foundations are no longer in
		play. Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate
		Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        You can't go digging through junkyards. Once a card is buried in the
		waste, it is hard to get back. Try and move as many cards from the
		Waste to the Tableau as possible.
