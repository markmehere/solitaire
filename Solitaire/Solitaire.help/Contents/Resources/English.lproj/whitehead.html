      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color. Builds of cards
        that are the same suit and in sequence can be moved as a unit.
        Empty Tableau slots can be filled with any card or build of cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top
        card in Waste is in play. There are no redeals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in
        Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move
        it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Empty Tableau slots are a prized commodity in this game. Sometimes
        keeping them around until you need them is a very good idea.
