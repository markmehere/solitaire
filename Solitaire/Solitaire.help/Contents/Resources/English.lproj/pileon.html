      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Fifteen piles, arranged in rows of four. Deal cards four at a time, face up onto the first thirteen piles. Leave the last two spaces empty. A pile can hold as many as four cards, and as few as none.</td></tr></tbody></table>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Rearrange the cards so that each pile contains all four cards from a single
		value. This should leave two piles empty, but it doesn't matter whether
		they are the same piles which were empty at the start.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards can be moved on top of any other card or cards of the same value
		so long as no pile grows to have more than four cards. Groups of cards
		can be moved if they are of the same value, but it doesn't gain you
		anything. An empty slot can be filled with any card or group of cards
		with the same value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a pile contains all four cards of the same value it is frozen, and
		the top card is flipped to indicate that you need do nothing further
		to those cards. They are no longer in play, but it would be useless to
		move them anyway.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        When a pile of four cards is frozen you score 4 points, one for each
		card. There is no other way to score points.
      </p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Keep one of the piles clear as much as possible. Don't allow a pile of
		three cards to build up on top of a single card, especially if the
		final card from the set is not a bottom card in another pile.
      </p>
