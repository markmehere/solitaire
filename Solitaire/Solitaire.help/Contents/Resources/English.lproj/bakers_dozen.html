      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        The top card on each Tableau can be moved to another Tableau pile if
        it has a value of one lower than the top card on the second pile.
        Suit is not relevant. Empty Tableau piles cannot be filled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in
        Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card in the
        Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a
        move is possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card moved to the Foundation scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>Be careful not to bury low cards. Try to keep Tableau piles from emptying.</p>
