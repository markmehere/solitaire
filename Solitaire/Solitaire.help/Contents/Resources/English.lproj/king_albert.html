There is no building on the Reserves. Empty Reserve piles can not be filled.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Nine piles of cards, with nine cards in the first pile, eight in the second, and so on to the one card in the last pile. These cards are dealt face down. The top card in every pile is then flipped up.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Empty
        Tableau slots can be filled by any card or build of cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards in the Reserve can be played on to the Tableau or the
        Foundation. Empty Reserve piles cannot be filled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundation piles are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in
        Foundation are still in play.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Remember that any card can be placed on an empty Tableau slot.
        Exposing new cards is the top priority in this game.
