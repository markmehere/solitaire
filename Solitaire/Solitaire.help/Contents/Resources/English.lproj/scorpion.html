      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Create four piles of thirteen cards each, each pile consisting of one suit and in rank order.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by suit. Groups of cards can be
		moved regardless of sequence. An empty pile in the Tableau can be
		filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any point, clicking on the Stock will deal the last three cards, one
		each on the first three piles.
      </p>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        For every sequence in suit, points given is (length of sequence - 1).
		Each time a sequence of thirteen is created and is in its own slot, four
		extra points are awarded. Reaching a card that was face down gives
		three points.
      </p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 100</p>

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>Unknotting knots is not often easy. Avoid tangling yourself up with no way out.</p>
