      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. No redeals.</td></tr><tr><td>Waste</td><td>All play is on the Waste pile. Cards faced down are not part of the current scoring run.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Deal 18 cards face down in the form of three triangles, with three rows in each triangle, increasing with one card in the first row to three in the last. Connect the triangles by dealing another 10 cards face up in the bottom row. End cards of each row should overlap the end cards of the row above, and interior cards should overlap two adjacent cards of that row.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Exposed cards in the Tableau are available for play. Build on the top card of
		Waste with cards ranked immediately above or below it from the Tableau, 
		regardless of suit. Aces are ranked both above Kings and below Deuces.
      </p>
      <p>Tableau cards are made available when not covered by other cards.</p>
      <p>Cards can be flipped singly from Stock to the top of Waste.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Options</h2>
      <p>
        Multiplier Scoring: Points double for every card played in a run. A run
		of five cards will score 1, 2, 4, 16, and 32 points, for a total of 55 
		points. Bonuses are worth 25 points. No points are deducted for playing
		a card from the stock to the waste.
      </p>
      <p>
        Progressive Rounds: After all cards have been cleared from the tableu, 
		a new round begins. The score from the last round carries over into the
		new round.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        The score for each card played is equal to the number of cards your have
		played since the last card flipped from the Stock to the Waste. The longer
		the run, the higher your score.
      </p>
      <p>
        5 points are deducted when you flip a card from Stock to Waste. Each 
		triangle peak cleared will give a 15 point bonus, and an additional 15
		points are awarded when all the cards have been cleared from the Tableau.
      </p>
      <p>Maximum possible score for a single round: 466</p>
