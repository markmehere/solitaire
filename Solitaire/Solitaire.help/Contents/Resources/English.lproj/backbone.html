      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Double Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Single pile below the foundations on the left.

To be built up in suit from Ace to King.</td></tr><tr><td>Reserve</td><td>Two stacks of 9 cards each, with a single above both stacks. Cards that are not obscured are available for play to anywhere except empty tableau spaces.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Eight piles, four on each side of the reserve.

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by suit. Only one card can be moved
        at a time. Empty slots can be filled with any card except from the reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually. Top
        card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in
        Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the
        deck twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in the
        Foundations are no longer in play. Double clicking on a card will move
        it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is
        possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 104</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        You can use empty spaces in the Tableau to move multiple cards. Be careful
        with Kings in the Reserve: the only way to remove them is by playing them
        to a Foundation on top of a Queen.
