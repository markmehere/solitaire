      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards of 6 or smaller to the center pile, 7 or greater to corner piles.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Click on the stock to flip over cards. Move one card at the time to the tableau. Once placed on a foundation pile, a card cannot be moved. Each corner pile is built up from 7 to king. Center pile is built down from 6 to ace. After ace comes another 6, etc. Suit doesn't count.

    <div>
      <h2>Options</h2>
      <p>
        Deal Three Cards: If you deal three cards at a time from the stock, you get to go through the deck three times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Autoplay: If autoplay is activated, cards are automatically placed to foundation piles as soon as possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>Try to keep reserve. It's not easy to get Napoleon to his tomb, but keep trying.</p>
