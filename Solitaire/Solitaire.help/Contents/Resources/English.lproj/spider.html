      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Double Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. Deck placed here after dealing onto Tableau. Clicking deals one card face up to every pile.</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation</td><td>Top eight piles. Only used to hold sequences of cards going down from King down to Ace once completed.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Ten piles. Four piles (piles 1, 4, 7, and 10) get dealt 5 cards down and one card up while rest of the piles get dealt 4 cards down and one card up. Cards can be built down regardless of suit. Sequences of cards in the same suit can be moved as a unit. Empty piles can be filled with any card or movable unit.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>To have eight sequences of cards going down from King down to Ace in the foundation.</p>
      <p>
        If you want an extremely difficult challenge, do not move completed
        sequences of cards to a foundation.
        You can also win by leaving the same eight sequences in the tableau.
        This is harder because there are fewer empty piles available. In fact,
        it is nearly impossible.
      </p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Build down regardless of suit. Sequences of cards in the same suit can
		be moved as a unit. Empty piles can be filled with any card or legal
		sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking on the Stock pile at any time deals a card face up to every
		pile. However, all piles must be non-empty. If an empty pile exists,
		an error message will appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sequence of cards going down from King down to Ace can be moved to a foundation pile. Once
		there, these cards are no longer in play.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Options</h2>
      <p>There are three possible types of deck. Each deck has 104 cards.</p>
      <ul><li><b>One Suit</b><p>The deck is an octuple deck of Spades only. This is the simplest of the spider decks and a good way to learn the basics.</p></li><li><b>Two Suits</b><p>The deck is a quadruple deck of Hearts and Spades only. There are four complete sequences of cards for each suit. This is not quite as diabolical as the standard four suit spider deck.</p></li><li><b>Four Suits</b><p>The deck is a standard double deck. There are two complete sequences of cards for each suit. This is the standard Spider deck. It is also the most difficult.</p></li></ul>
      <p>
        Many traditional implementations of Spider do not use a foundation
        and simply remove completed sequences of cards. This has no impact upon game
        play.

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>For every sequence in suit, points given is (length of sequence - 1).</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 96</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        If at first you don't succeed, don't become addicted. Build in suit
		whenever possible, but expose as many cards as you can.
