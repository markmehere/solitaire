      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Clicking on the Stock will deal one card to each of the Tableau
        piles. If any of the cards showing in the Tableau are of the same
        rank, move the others on to the leftmost of the like cards. Empty
        piles can only be filled by an ensuing deal from Stock.
      </p>
      <p>If at any point, all four cards showing are the same rank, they are removed.</p>
      <p>
        When Stock is empty, the Tableau piles are gathered, right pile on
        left, and placed back into stock. The first card dealt will always
        be the first card dealt until it is removed. There are unlimited
        redeals.
      </p>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each set of four cards removed scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 13</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Don't forget to use the brakes!
        This game might never end unless
        you decide carefully whether or not to make a move.
