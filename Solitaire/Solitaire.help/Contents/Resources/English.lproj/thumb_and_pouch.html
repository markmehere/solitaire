      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by any suit but own. Groups of
        cards can be moved. An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with
        a any legal sequence of cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards are flipped from the stock to the Waste individually. Top
        card in Waste is in play. When Stock is empty, move all cards in
        Waste back to the Stock, maintaining order. You can go through the
        deck three times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in
        Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move
        it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>Brute force may not always work, but in this case it probably will.</p>
