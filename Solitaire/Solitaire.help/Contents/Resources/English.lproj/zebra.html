      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in Tableau are built down by alternate color. Only the top card
		of each pile is in play. However, to facilitate play, a whole pile can
		be moved to an appropriate Foundation with one drag. Double clicking on
		a pile will move the top card to an appropriate Foundation pile if
		possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spaces in Tableau are automatically filled from the Waste, or if Waste
		is empty, from the Stock.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stock is dealt on to Waste singly. Top card of Waste is available for
		play. There is one redeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up by alternate color from Aces to Kings. Cards
		in Foundation piles are no longer in play.
      </p>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 96</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        There are very few second chances in the real world, so use them when
		you find them. Chances are you will need to use the second deal to win
		this game. Remember where the key cards are and you'll be glad you
		did.
