      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. No redeals.</td></tr><tr><td>Waste</td><td>To be taken from Stock.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Deal face down seven overlapping rows starting with one card on the first row, increasing by one per row and staggering the piles as to achieve a pyramid.

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to Waste.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        All exposed cards in the pyramid are available for play. Build on to
		the Waste from these available cards whenever possible by playing a
		card with a rank immediately above or immediately below the rank of
		the top card in the Waste. Aces are both above Kings and below Deuces.
      </p>
      <p>Cards can be flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste. There is no redeal.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card removed from the pyramid scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 28</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Every pyramid needs a strong foundation. Get rid of the lower cards
		first, with an eye out to try to expose as many cards as possible.
