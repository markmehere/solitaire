      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. There are no redeals.</td></tr><tr><td>Reserve</td><td>Three piles to the right of Stock. One card is dealt into each of the Reserves every time the Stock is clicked.</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation</td><td>Four piles on the top right. Foundations are built up in sequence regardless of suit.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Deal face up eight piles of three cards each.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down regardless of suit. Cards can
        only be moved singly. An empty pile in the Tableau can not be
        filled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards are flipped from the Stock on to the three Reserve piles, one
        card each per deal. Top card of each Reserve pile is available for
        play. Empty Reserve piles cannot be filled except with the next
        deal from Stock.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundation piles are built up regardless of suit from Ace to King.
        Cards in Foundation are no longer in play.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Never look backwards. Cards that are locked in backwards order are
        to be dealt with as soon as possible. Move as many cards from the
        Reserve on to the Tableau as you can, for Kings are hard to move.
