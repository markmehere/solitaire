      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating-colors. Cards are
        moved singly or in groups. An empty slot in the Tableau can be filled with any card. There is an option to restrict the movement to
        only cards of the same suit. See below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards are dealt from the Stock to the Tableau in complete rows. The reserve may be empty or
        occupied as you wish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up from suit from Ace to King. Top cards in
        Foundations are still in play. Double clicking on a card will move
        it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible. Double clicking on a Foundation
        will automatically move as many cards as possible to the Foundations.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Options</h2>
      <p>
        There are two ways to play. The difference between them
        is in how the cards may be built in the tableau.
      </p>
      <ul><li><b>Same suit</b><p>Cards must be of the same suit to be moved as a group and must be placed on a card of the same suit.</p></li><li><b>Alternating colors</b><p>To be moved as a group cards must be in a sequence of alternating colors. The top card must be placed on a card of the opposite color.</p></li></ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 104</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>Avoid leaving small cards buried in the tableau. Use the Reserve wisely.</p>
