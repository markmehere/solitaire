      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Remove all cards.</p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        The Tableau is built down by alternate color. Builds of cards in
        sequence and alternating color can be moved as a unit. Empty
        Tableau piles can be filled by Kings or builds starting with a King.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any empty Tableau slots must be filled if possible before dealing
        more cards. Clicking on the Stock deals one card face up on to each
        Tableau pile. The last deal places one card face up on the first
        three piles. There are no redeals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Foundation is built up in suit from Ace to King. Cards in the
        Foundation are no longer in play.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card placed on to a Foundation scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Move cards up to the Foundation when you can because the next deal
        may block it. However since cards in the Foundation are no longer
        in play, you may get stuck later needing that card. Hopefully this
        conundrum will be the most difficult one facing you today.
