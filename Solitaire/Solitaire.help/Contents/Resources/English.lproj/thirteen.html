      <p>Remove all cards.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        All exposed cards in the pyramid are available for play. Kings can
        be removed singly. All other cards can be removed in pairs that add
        up to thirteen with Aces equal to 1, Jacks equal to 11, and Queens
        equal to 12.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards can be flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste. The top
        card is available for play either with the available cards in the
        pyramid or with the card below. There is no redeal.

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card removed scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Every pyramid needs a strong foundation. Get rid of the lower cards
        first, with an eye out to try to expose as many cards as possible.
