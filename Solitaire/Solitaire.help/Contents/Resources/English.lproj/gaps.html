    <h1>Gaps</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>All cards are dealt into four rows of 13 cards each; the aces are then discarded to leave four gaps. Two redeals are allowed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>To place all cards in sequence from 2 to king, in suit.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Gaps in the leftmost column may be filled by moving a 2 of any suit
        there. A gap to the right of any non-King card may be filled by placing
        the card with the same suit but one rank higher into the gap. Gaps
        following Kings or other gaps may not be filled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a card is placed in a sequence starting with a 2 in the leftmost
        slot, it can no longer be moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        If no moves are possible (i.e., all gaps follow Kings),
        double-clicking any card will cause a redeal. Any cards not in sequence
        will be removed, shuffled, and redealt. Only two redeals are allowed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Options</h2>
      <p>
        Randomly Placed Gaps on Redeal: Check this to have randomly placed gaps 
 after a redeal. If unchecked, the gaps will always be placed directly to the 
 right of any cards already in sequence after redealing.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        Each card placed in sequence, starting with a two in the leftmost slot,
        is worth one point.
      </p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>Put off making any move that will add a gap after a king for as long as possible.</p>
