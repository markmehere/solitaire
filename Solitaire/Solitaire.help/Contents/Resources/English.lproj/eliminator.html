		<h2>Setup</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Four piles. Deal 13 cards to each. (This is all of the cards.)</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation</td><td>Four to six empty slots that you build in either direction.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
    <div>
		<h2>Goal</h2><p>Move all cards to Foundation.</p></div>
    <div>
		<h2>Rules</h2><p>
        Any card can be placed as the first card in the Foundation. 
		Foundation piles can be built up or down from the top card's 
		value, disregarding suit. Kings can be placed on Aces and 
		vice versa.
      </p></div>
    <div>
		<h2>Scoring</h2><p>Every card moved from the Tableau on top of a card in the Foundation scores one point.</p><p>Maximum possible score: 51</p></div>
    <div>
		<h2>Strategy</h2><p>
        Make sure to look at all the cards coming up, and be sure 
		you're not going to lock any cards that are necessary to 
		move the one on top.
