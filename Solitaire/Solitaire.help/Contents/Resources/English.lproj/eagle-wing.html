      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste. Two redeals.</td></tr><tr><td>Waste</td><td>Directly to the right of Stock. To be taken from Stock. Top card available for play.</td></tr><tr><td>Foundations</td><td>Four piles top right. One card is dealt in the first Foundation at the start of the game, this is the base card. Other Foundations must be started with a card of the same rank as the base card. To be built up in suit from the base card.</td></tr><tr><td>Reserve</td><td>Middle (and lowest) slot. Deal thirteen cards face down here. Flip card to fill any spaces in the Tableau. When only one card is left in the Reserve, it will flip up and can be played on Foundation or a Tableau pile.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Eight slots (four to the left and four to the right of Reserve.) Deal one card face up per slot. Tableau can be built down by suit. Cards can be moved singly to other slots on the Tableau, or in a group on to the Foundation.

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the tableau are built down by suit. Cards can only be
        moved singly to another Tableau pile. However, to ease monotony,
        groups of cards can be moved to Foundation. An empty slot in the
        Tableau is filled automatically from the Reserve. If the Reserve is
        empty, an empty slot can be filled by a card from the Waste or from
        another Tableau pile.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Reserve exists mainly to deal cards into empty slots of the
        Tableau. However, when there is only one card left in the Reserve,
        it will become visible and is in play.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste singly. When the
        Stock is empty, move all cards in Waste back to the Stock,
        maintaining order. You can go through the deck three times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit from the base card (first card
        dealt to first Foundation). New Foundations are started when a card
        of the same rank as the first card placed during the dealing period
        are placed on empty Foundation piles. Aces are placed on Kings, and
        twos on Aces. Cards in Foundations are not in play.

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        A little planning goes a long way. Check before piling cards in a
        Tableau. Remember the three card in a slot rule.
