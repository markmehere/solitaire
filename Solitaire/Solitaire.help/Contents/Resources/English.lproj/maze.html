      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>48 cards: Standard Deck without the kings</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Fifty-four spaces in six rows of nine each. Deal cards into spaces one to eight. Leave space nine blank. Deal cards into spaces ten to seventeen. Leave space eighteen blank. Deal the remaining cards similarly. Then remove all the kings (which play no further part in the game), so that six empty spaces remain in total. Any card can be moved into a space to the left of another card of the same suit and face value one higher. Any card can be moved into a space to the right of another card of the same suit and face value one lower. An ace may be moved to the right of a queen or in the top left space. A queen may be moved to the left of an ace or in the bottom right space.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Put each suit of cards into ascending order, with an ace in the
        top left corner, to create a run of cards: Ace to Queen of one suit,
        Ace to Queen of another, Ace to Queen of the third, Ace to Queen
        of the fourth.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards are moved singly. Any card can be moved into a space to the
        left of another card of face value one higher in the same suit. Any
        card can be moved into a space to the right of another card of face
        value one lower in the same suit. An ace may be moved to the right
        of a queen or in the top left space. A queen may be moved to the left
        of an ace or in the bottom right space.
      </p>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        Each card placed next to another card of the same suit in the
        correct order scores one point.
      </p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Multiple adjacent spaces enable you to generate long sequences of
        cards. Beware of getting trapped into a situation where you move
        one card endlessly between two points.
