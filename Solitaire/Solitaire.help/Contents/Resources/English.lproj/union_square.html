      <p>Move all cards to Foundations.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in Tableau can be built either up or down in suit. However, each
		pile must follow only one of these rules. For example, if a Tableau
		pile has a three of clubs over a two of clubs, one can only play a four
		of clubs on this pile. Any available card can be played on to an empty
		Tableau pile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundation piles are to be built in suit from Ace to King, followed by
		another King, then back down to Ace, giving 26 cards per pile when game
		is won. Cards in Foundation piles are no longer in play.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards can be flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste. Top card of
		Waste is available for play. There is no redeal.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card moved to Foundations scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 104</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        A string of beads can be added to from both ends, and so should your
		piles. Make good use of any empty slots to append cards. With a little
		perseverance, this game can be a lot of fun!
