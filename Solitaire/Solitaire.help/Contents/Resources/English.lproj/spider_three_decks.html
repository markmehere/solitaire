      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Triple Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. Deck placed here after dealing onto Tableau. Clicking deals one card face up to every pile.</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation</td><td>Top twelve piles. Not part of "official rules".</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Twelve piles. The first six piles get dealt 4 cards down and one card up while rest of the piles get dealt 3 cards down and one card up. Cards can be built down regardless of suit. Sequences of cards in the same suit can be moved as a unit. Empty piles can be filled with any card or movable unit.</td></tr></tbody></table>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        To have twelve sequences of cards (three for each suit) going down from King
		down to Ace in the foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want an extremely difficult challenge, you can also win by forming the same twelve sequences in the tableau. This is harder because there are fewer empty piles available. In fact, it is nearly impossible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Build down regardless of suit. Sequences of cards in the same suit can
		be moved as a unit. Empty piles can be filled with any card or legal
		sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking on the Stock pile at any time deals a card face up to every
		pile. Unlike in other Spider variants, empty piles are allowed at redeals.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sequence of thirteen cards can be moved to a foundation pile. Once
		there, these cards are no longer in play.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>For every sequence in suit, points given is (length of sequence - 1).</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 144</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        If at first you don't succeed, don't become addicted. Build in suit
		whenever possible, but expose as many cards as you can.
      </p>
