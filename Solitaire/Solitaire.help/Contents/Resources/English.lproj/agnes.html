      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Stock</td><td>Top left pile. The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau. Cards are dealt in batches of seven, one on every Tableau pile.</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation</td><td>Four piles top right. To be built in suit and sequence, wrapping from King to Ace when necessary. One card is dealt on to the first Foundation pile. The other Foundation piles must be started with cards of the same rank.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Seven piles. Deal card face up in first pile. Place one card face down on all other piles. Place one card face up on next pile followed by one card face down on all the covered piles. Repeat until there are seven cards in last pile. Tableau can be built down in same colors. Groups of cards can be moved. Empty piles can only be filled by the next deal from the Stock.</td></tr></tbody></table>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color. Groups of cards
        in sequence and same color can be moved as a unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each deal flips one card from the Stock to each pile of the
        Tableau. There are no redeals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up in suit in sequence, wrapping from King to
        Ace when necessary. Cards in Foundations are still in play. Double
        clicking on a card in the Tableau will move it to the appropriate
        Foundation pile if such a move is possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card in Foundation scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Try to build down in suit whenever possible. Try to score as many
        points as you can as this game is very hard to win.
