      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        The first item of play is to select an available card for the first
        Foundation. Once selected, all other Foundations must also start
        with this value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foundations are built up by suit, wrapping from King to Ace where
        necessary. Once a card is placed on a Foundation pile, it is out of
        play.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color. Whole
        piles of cards can be moved on to another Tableau pile. Empty slots
        in the Tableau can be filled by any available card in the Reserves
        or, if all the Reserves are empty, from the Waste.
      </p>
      <p>Cards are flipped singly from Stock to Waste. There is one redeal.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card placed on to the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 52</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Be careful when selecting your first Foundation pile. Try to get
        the cards out of the Reserves as early as possible. Sometimes
        keeping cards in play is more important than moving them to the
        Foundation.
