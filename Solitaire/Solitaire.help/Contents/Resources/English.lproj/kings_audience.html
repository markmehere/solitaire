      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Deal cards one at a time from Stock to Waste. Whenever a King and Queen of
        the same suit are available, they can be moved into a throne slot by either
        by dragging the King onto the Queen (or vice versa) or double clicking either
        card. Whenever a Jack and Ace of the same suit are available, they can be
        moved into a foundation slot in the same manner.
