      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Play begins by dealing four cards to the Reserve. If possible, play
        cards on to the Foundation from the Reserve. Continue this process
        until no cards are left in stock and no more moves on to Foundation
        can be made. A similar game that is a bit easier is Scuffle.

      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Do you believe in Luck?
        Although this game takes more skill to play
        than Clock, the skill involved entails paying attention. A great
        game for brainless play.
