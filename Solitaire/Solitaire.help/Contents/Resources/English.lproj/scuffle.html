      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Move all cards to the Foundation piles.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Play begins by dealing four cards face up on to the Reserve. If
        possible, play cards on to the Foundation from the Reserve. Continue
        this process until no cards are left in stock and no more moves on
        to the Foundation can be made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take all cards left over on the Reserve and reshuffle. Place these
        cards back to the stock for redealing. There are two redeals.
      </p>

      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>Each card placed on to the Foundation piles scores one point.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 48</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Try to keep in mind what is underneath the Reserve piles. When
        given a choice, it is this knowledge which should help you decide
        which card to play.
