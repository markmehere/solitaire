      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <table><tbody><tr><td>Type of Deck</td><td>Standard Deck</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation</td><td>One pile at top. Build in sequence for diamonds starting from any diamond of your choice.</td></tr><tr><td>Tableau</td><td>Thirteen piles. Deal three cards face down and one card face up on every pile.</td></tr></tbody></table>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Remove all diamonds to the foundation and have all the other cards
        in suit and sequence with Aces being low in the Tableau.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Cards (other than diamonds) can be built down in sequence regardless
        of suit. Builds of cards can be moved as a unit. Empty slots can
        be filled by any card (except for diamonds) or build of cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Diamonds cannot be moved except to be place on to the Foundation.
        The diamond Foundation must be built up in sequence but can start
        from any number you want.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        Each diamond placed on to the Foundation scores the face value of
        the card, with Ace as one point, Jacks as eleven points, Queens as
        twelve points, and Kings as thirteen points.
      </p>
      <p>Each Ace through King in sequence and in suit on the Tableau pile scores three points.</p>
      <p>Maximum possible score: 100</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Mining for diamonds is hard work. Keep in mind that not all
        diamonds are worth the same. Don't forget to clean up after
        yourself and put the other suits in order.
